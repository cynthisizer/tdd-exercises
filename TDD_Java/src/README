Welcome to TDD (Test Driven Development)!

This exercise is meant for those who have little to no TDD experience.  You are expected to know some programming - but
never fear - TDD can be used to help you learn programming concepts that seem like magic.

This base maven project has been setup with just enough tools and configurations to get you started. However - you are not
bound to use the pom as-is; you should feel to explore and use whatever libraries your heart desires.

To complete this exercise - follow the TDD Kata script in the project: calculator-tdd.txt
> You should follow the Red > Green > Amber flow:
  (1) Write a unit test that should check the feature that you're developing
  (2) Run the test so that it fails
      * If you're using an IDE you can use it to help you generate your methods from your junit tests
  (3) Write the minimum amount of code to make your test pass
  (4) Once your test has passed do some refactoring (as needed) where you're happy with your code
      *IMPORTANT - do not add any additional features unless you have a unit test case for it
  (5) Move on to the next feature


You're more than welcome to store your project on your own GIT site. If you haven't started one - this would be a great sample to put up to start collaborating with others.
